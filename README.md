## Devlog
Unity is a play. Scenes are stages upon which the play is set; they contain the play's reality. All of the actors and props performing on each stage comprise a Scene's GameObjects. Every actor and prop contains certain information about themselves, such as their appearance, location, physical properties, and functions - these are a GameObject's Components. Without Components, the props and actors (GameObjects) have no form. Without props and actors, the stage is empty. Without a stage, there can be no play.
